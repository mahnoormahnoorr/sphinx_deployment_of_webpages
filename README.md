## Sphinx Deployment of Webpages

This repo contain information about sphinx deployment of github into a webpage. Instractuion folder has all relevant information about how to run it. 

When you run this command `sphinx-quickstart docs` it creates files within docs folder: build, make.bat, Makefile, source. 

Build will be the empty folder where files will store up after you run the webpage. For-example if you deploy webpage, 2 folders named as `doctress` and `html` will open in Build that will have other files and sub folder in it. `html` folder is very important in terms of deploying webpage from github to make it public. For private usage,  `open docs/build/html/index.html` will open up the webpage. 

Source is the folder where you put all relevant files that you need in your webpage.
